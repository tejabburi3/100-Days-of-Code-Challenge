## 🎮 Game Overview

Your mission is simple but dangerous:

> **Find the One Piece.**

- A crossroad decision
- A dangerous lake crossing
- An island with multiple paths
- A final door that decides your fate

⚠️ **Warning:**  
The sea is unpredictable. Even the right choice can fail.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This game is intentionally designed with **randomness** to ensure replayability.

- ✔️ Correct choices do **not guarantee success**
- ✔️ Prevents players from memorizing answers
- ✔️ Reflects real-life uncertainty and fate
- ✔️ One chance is given to fix spelling mistakes — after that, consequences apply

> Life gives limited chances — this game does too.
