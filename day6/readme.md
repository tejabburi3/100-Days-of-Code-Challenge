# Library Management System 📚

## 📌 Description
This project is a **Command Line Library Management System** built using Python.  
It simulates a real-world library where **each book can have multiple copies (10–20 or more)**.

The system allows users to manage books, track available copies, and perform borrow/return operations using a menu-driven interface.

## 🛠 Concepts Used
- Python functions
- While loops
- Dictionaries (nested dictionaries)
- Conditional statements
- Input validation
- State management

---

## 📂 Data Structure Used
Each book is stored with **total copies** and **available copies**.

Example:
```python
"Python Basics": {
    "total": 10,
    "available": 7
}
