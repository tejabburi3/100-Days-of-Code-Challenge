🐍 Snake Game – Python (Turtle Graphics)

A classic Snake Game built using Python and Turtle graphics.
The player controls a snake to eat food, increase the score, and avoid collisions with walls and itself.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, event handling, and basic game development concepts in Python.

The snake moves continuously using a timer-based loop

Food appears at random positions

When the snake eats food:

Snake touches itself

❌ Game Over

When the game ends, “GAME OVER” is displayed at the center of the screen, and movement stops.
