Number Guessing Game (Python)

A fun and interactive console-based Number Guessing Game written in Python.
The player must guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts based on the selected difficulty level.

🕹️ How the Game Works

The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.

The player chooses a difficulty level:

Easy → 10 attempts

Hard → 5 attempts

After each guess, the game provides hints:

📉 Little Low / ⬇️ Too Low

📈 Little High / ⬆️ Too High

The game ends when:

🎉 The player guesses the number correctly, or

💀 The player runs out of attempts

After each round, the player can choose to play again or exit.
