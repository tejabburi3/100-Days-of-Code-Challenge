# Menu-Driven Calculator with Result History 🧮

## 📌 Description
This project is a **command-line calculator** built using Python.
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and optionally
**continue calculations using the previous result**.

The program runs in a loop until the user decides to exit.

---

## 🛠 Concepts Used
- Python functions
- While loops
- Conditional statements
- User input handling
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Control flow with `continue` and `break`

---

## ➕ Supported Operations
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)  
  - Division by zero is safely handled

---

## ▶ How the Calculator Works
1. User enters the first number.
2. User selects an operator.
3. User enters the second number.
4. Result is displayed.
5. User can:
   - Continue using the previous result, or
   - Start a new calculation, or
   - Exit the program.

## 🧪 Sample Run
--Enter the first number: 10
--Enter the operator: +
--Enter the second number: 5
--Result of 10 + 5 = 15

--Do you want to use the previous result? (yes/no): yes
--Enter the operator: *
--Enter the second number: 2
--Result of 15 * 2 = 30
